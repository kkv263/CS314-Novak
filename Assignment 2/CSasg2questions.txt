Questions asked in Assignment 2
  2. Can you think of an invariant (property that is always true) of peanoplus? What is the Big O of peanoplus?
  	-Because its recursion, it will be called y number of times. The Big O is O(n)
  3. What is the Big O of peanotimes?
  	-The Big O of peanotimes is O(n^2) because peanoplus used peanotimes y times, and peanoplus is ran y 
	number of times. so y*y = y^2
  8. What is the relationship between the (choose n k) values and the binomial coeffiecients?
	-each row is calculated using the (choose n k) formula. Each space in each row ranges from 0 to n.
	For example if n = 4, then (1 4 6 4 1) are the answers to C(4,0), C(4,1), C(4,2)... C(4,n)
