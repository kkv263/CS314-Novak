<H2>CS 314 Assignment 11: MapReduce</H2>

<H3>Due: December 4, 2015.</H3>

<B>Files:</B> <tt>Cons.java</tt> &nbsp; <tt>MapReduce.java</tt> &nbsp;

<P>
This assignment should be done in Java.
The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience with MapReduce
programming.  MapReduce is used by Google for much of their
processing of large data sets (terabytes of data).  Hadoop is an
open-source version of MapReduce written in Java; it is available
to commercial users through Amazon Web Services.
For this assignment, we will use a simplified version of MapReduce;
the way in which it is programmed is similar to Hadoop.
<P>
A MapReduce program has two basic components provided by the user, a
<tt>Mapper</tt> and a <tt>Reducer</tt>; these in turn have methods 
<tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt>.  The <tt>MapReduce</tt> class
calls the methods and manages the data.
<P>
<tt>map</tt> has two arguments,
a <tt>String key</tt> and a <tt>String value</tt>, plus the
<tt>MapReduce mr</tt>.  For our purposes, the <tt>key</tt> will be
a line number (sometimes used, sometimes not used), and the
<tt>value</tt> will be a line of text.  <tt>map</tt> will emit
zero or more items of data by calling <tt>mr.collect_map</tt> with
arguments of a <tt>key</tt> and a <tt>value</tt> that is a list of one
<tt>String</tt> (potentially more).
Note that the <tt>key</tt> in the call to <tt>mr.collect_map</tt>
is often different from the <tt>key</tt> parameter to the
<tt>map</tt> method.  As an example, suppose that the mapper program
detects some conditions in the lines of input text and wants to
count those conditions; for condition foo, the call to emit this
output would be <tt>mr.collect_map("foo", list("1"));</tt>  In this case,
<tt>"foo"</tt> is the key, and the value is a list of one <tt>String</tt>
value, in this case denoting one occurrence of foo.
<P>
The <tt>reduce</tt> method gets a <tt>key</tt> that is a <tt>String</tt>,
and a <tt>value</tt> that is a list of lists of (usually one) <tt>String</tt>.
The <tt>value</tt> contains all the values emitted for that <tt>key</tt>
by the <tt>map</tt> method, collected into a single list.  The task
of <tt>reduce</tt> is to produce an answer from the list of values
and output that answer by calling <tt>mr.collect_reduce</tt> .  The answer
is of type <tt>Cons</tt>, a list of the key and combined value.  As
an example, if there are 3 occurrences of foo, the <tt>value</tt>
would be <tt>(("1") ("1") ("1"))</tt> ; the quotation marks are shown
here to emphasize that the values are <tt>String</tt> and must be parsed
to get integer values, e.g. by <tt>Integer.decode()</tt>.  The final value
might be a list <tt>("foo" 3)</tt>, where the <tt>3</tt> is the
<tt>Integer</tt> combined value.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> An example pair of methods to perform a line count of a file is
provided.  This example simply emits
<tt>mr.collect_map("line", list("1"));</tt> for each line.  The <tt>reduce</tt>
method parses and adds the 1 counts, to emphasize this technique,
although it could simply find the <tt>length</tt> of the list.
<P>
<LI> Write <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> methods to count the number
of occurrences of each alphabetic character in a file.  The count for
each letter should be case-insensitive (i.e., include both upper-case
and lower-case versions of the letter).  Ignore non-alphabetic
characters.  Character frequency counts can be used in breaking
substitution ciphers.

((a 484) (b 95) (c 187)  ...)
</PRE>

<LI> Write <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> methods to count the number
of occurrences of each word in a file.
For the purposes of this assignment a word will be defined as any
string of alphabetic characters appearing between non-alphabetic
characters. <TT>nature's</TT> is two words.
The count should be case-insensitive.
If a word occurs multiple times in a line, all should be counted.
A <tt>StringTokenizer</tt> is a convenient way to parse the words from
the input line.  There is documentation of <tt>StringTokenizer</tt>
online, and there is an example of its use in the <tt>reader</tt>
functions.

<P>
<LI> Write <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> methods to perform a
<tt>grep</tt> to find occurrences of a given string (case-sensitive)
in a file.
The desired string is obtained as <tt>mr.parameter()</tt> ; it may
occur more than once in a given line.  The output should use the
desired string as a key and give a list of all the line numbers
(as <tt>Integer</tt>) on which the string occurs.  If a word
occurs multiple times in a line, the line number should be output
multiple times.
<PRE>

</PRE>

<LI> Write <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> methods to construct an
index of words in a file.  For each word, the index should give a list
of the line numbers (as <tt>Integer</tt>) on which the word occurs in
the file.  The index should be case-insensitive.  If a word
occurs multiple times in a line, all should be included in the index.

<P>
<LI> Write <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> methods to determine
the average ratings of movies.  The input consists of a series
of lines, each containing a movie number, user number, rating, and
date:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <TT>
3980,294028,5,2005-11-15
</TT>
<P>
<tt>map</tt> should emit movie number and list of rating, and
<tt>reduce</tt> should return for each movie number a list of
average rating as <tt>Double</tt>, and number of ratings as
<tt>Integer</tt>.  This data is similar to the Netflix Prize data.
